/*
@doc This VDM file defines named constructs used by the Isabelle theory file "VDMToolkit.thy". These are important so
		 that during code generation to Isabelle, AST transformations can be type checked. This is achieved by implicitly
		 importing all definitions from here. Their sole purpose is to allow the on-the-fly (IR) spec to be albe to check
		 for type correctness. Definitions of such functions are provided for/by Isabelle fine-tuned automation choices
		 for VDM mathematical toolkit (e.g. list_all instead of a explict forall for isa_invSeqElems).

		 By convention, evrery bridged name will start with the "isa_" keyword.

types
/*
@doc These types are important to ensure that type widening rules don't break in Isabelle (e.g. 0 - (x::nat) case
		 in VDM has int type, whereas in Isabelle is always 0 with nat type.

		 Even for VDM int itself, it is useful to Decorate/Bridge (in the design pattern sense) it with a synonym name
		 in case we want to play in Isabelle with how these things are represented (e.g. int x real later on).

		 This also shileds the intermediate representation Java code and Velocity templates from variations in
		 the translation strategy (i.e. the templates are always in terms of isa_XXX), hence the whole translation
		 strategy can be leveraged by how VDMToolkit.vdmsl and VDMToolkit.thy are designed (i.e. less Java coding needs).

/*
@doc For the VDM implicit invariant checks, we have to explicitly have their equivalent in VDM so that the IR can be
		 typechecked without a problem. The target Isabelle theory file will contain them as well.

		 Their implementation is optional (i.e. same as "is not yet specified") given they will be already implemented
		 (and particularly tailored for) in Isabelle.
